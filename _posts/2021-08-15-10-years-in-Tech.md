## 10 Years in Tech

15th August 2011 - a milestone day in my life

My first venture into Tech as a career

I started as a graduate at LV= (a UK insurance company) as a PL/SQL developer working on migrating Oracle 10G to 11.

I uprooted myself and moved down to lovely Exeter, a shift from Yorkshire to more or less the bottom end of the UK!
 
---

### Hey, wait, how did I end up here?

Well saying that I started a job at LV= is all fine and good but there must be a backstory, there's always a backstory, right?!

Well, yeah there is and here it is:

I'd got out of Uni around June 2011 with a degree in Multimedia Technologies, fresh faced and ready to take on the world!

Hmmm, yeah about the 'take on the world' mantra.

I didn't really know how to take on the world.

I spoke with a free friends who were working on a call center at the time and I though to myself "taking on the world will require money and experience".

I applied for a Customer Advisor role at a local call center and a few weeks later, I started training to be able to speak to people (I think i'm quite good at it now)

I spent a few months in the call center, made some good friends and picked up some invaluable knowledge, but deep down I was constantly thinking "I've just spent 4 years earning a degree in a field / sector that my heart and mind are set on working in, how do I even get my foot in the door".

Fast-forward a little bit >>

### Banking and Cobalt get my interest

I was catching up with some Uni friends via phone calls (ah those were the days, no WhatsApp, no Telegram etc)

One of my friends told me he's currently working as a Cobalt developer at HSBC.

"Woah, Woah WOAH!, Hold up! you're working at HSBC AND you're a developer (I tried not to linger on the Cobalt element (haha) as I was more interested in how he got his start in Tech)

### Enter FDM

My friend elaborated that he'd come across a Brighton-based consultancy by the name of FDM, which provides graduate training in IT including Software Development, Software Testing, Application Support among others. 

I rang them and had a phone screening, they wanted me to come down to Brighton for an interview / logic test.

I'm in Yorkshire and Brighton, well Brighton is way down there ⬇️

So I told my parents about this oppurtunity and what I need to do. 

Dad to the rescue and a few weeks later (after finalising a date for me to come down to their office in Brighton) I'm up at 6am and along with my parents and sister and nephews, we're on our way 'down south'.

> ### _Smoothing sailing isn't always possible no matter how great the boat is._

One and half hours into the journey, we end up in some gridlock traffic, turns out about half a mile up the motorway, there's pretty bad car crash.

Time starts ticking ⏰

I need to be at the FDM office for 12pm 😲

Queue the human sat-nav known as my dad. 🗺️

Numerous country roads, fields and a small village or town, we're back on a stretch of the motorway and merrily on our way.

⏩⏩

5 minute to spare and I rush into the FDM office building. Yeah talk about punctual...

Interview - ✔️
Logic Test - ✔️
Gut feeling - 🤮

....or something like that

I get a call from FDM inviting me to a 3 day interview process. OK, let's do this!

Off to Manchester I go, some family kindly offered to let me stay with them while I went through the interview process (something i'm eternally grateful for :heart:)

## The Interview

A tech test - write a banking application in any of the following languages:

* Java
* C#
* Unix

I'd studied :coffee: at Uni, so I thought 'cool, i'll write it in Java'

`Oh hai anxiety, how are you?`

Turns out a bit off more than I can chew, I hammered away at the keyboard, I Googled like a mad-man:

"Nope, I can't do this, i'm going to go and tell the academy staff that I'm not a fan of this and can't complete this interview process"

It gets to the end of the day and i'm feeling pretty low and anxious, I go back to where I'm staying for the duration of the interview, take out a pen and paper and draw out what i'm envisioning for the system and what i've done so far.

Fast-forward the next day ⏩⏩⏩

### Day 2: 💡

✏️ + 📃 = 🎉

Day 2 is much more productive, I start designing out classes for each bit of the system....

#### :doughnut: to the rescue!

It gets to lunch time and i'm still nowhere near finished :(

I get up off my desk and go for a walk all the while thinking: 

"Ugh, I'm not cut out for this, I haven't got time to finish"

As i'm walking around Manchester Town Center, my eyes come across none other than a Krispy Kreme :doughnut: shop!

I'd never had a Krispy Kreme before but heard they were supposed to be some of the best doughnuts around!

I go in and order a custard filled :doughnut: and a mocha :coffee:

### The 💡 goes off

I rush back to the FDM office, sit back down and feel like an epiphany has hit me.

![Many Hours Later](/assets/manyhours.jpg)

I'M FINALLY DONE!

I've created a banking app in Java! Woo-hoo GO ME!

BUT...it's not fully finished and the ⏲️ has run out.

The person whose going to review my code comes over and sits down next to me and we begin discussing what i've built and certain bits of improvement.

#### The Final Hurdle!

So that's the tech part of the interview done, now time for the last bit - an interview with some of the Trainers in the Academy.

⏩⏩

## WELCOME TO FDM!

So it turns out I managed to get through the tech test and a few other interviews and FDM asks if I can start in January with them!

## The start of the long winding road.

January rolls around super quick, and I find myself on a train to Manchester for my first day of training!

Let's skip forward about 8 months and after learning:

* Unix
* Java
* Soft skills including presentations and mock interviews
* Software Testing techniques and principles

### Down and then further down

I get the oppurunity to interview at an Investment bank in Central London, I think it went pretty well. 

Out ouf the building and into the pouring rain! 🌧️

As I'm making my way to go to get a tube back to King's Cross, I get a call from one of the London-based account managers, asking me to come and see him in the London Office

🚇 ->  🚶‍♂️ -> 🏢

* Role in Exeter
* LV= looking for a PL/SQL Developer
* Interview is tomorrow (Wednesday)

"Yeah but I need to go back up to Yorkshire"

"It's a good oppurtunity, i'll book you a hotel and we'll go grab ou some essentials for an overnight stay.

Next:

* Hotel in Paddington
* Nestled between a line of shops
* Fish and Chips for my evening meal
  
## 5am wake up

I'm not a morning person but the train to Exeter was at 6am and took about 3 hours

I'm still 😪 but let's take the day as it goes
