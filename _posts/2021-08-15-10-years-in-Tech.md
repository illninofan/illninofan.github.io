## 10 Years in Tech

15th August 2011 - a milestone day in my life

My first venture into Tech as a career

I started as a graduate at LV= (a UK insurance company) as a PL/SQL developer working on migrating Oracle 10G to 11.

I uprooted myself and moved down to lovely Exeter, a shift from Yorkshire to more or less the bottom end of the UK!

---

### Hey, wait, how did I end up here?

Well saying that I started a job at LV= is all fine and good but there must be a backstory, there's always a backstory, right?!

Well, yeah there is and here it is:

I'd got out of Uni around June 2011 with a degree in Multimedia Technologies, fresh faced and ready to take on the world!

Hmmm, yeah about the 'take on the world' mantra.

I didn't really know how to take on the world.

I spoke with a free friends who were working on a call center at the time and I though to myself "taking on the world will require money and experience".

I applied for a Customer Advisor role at a local call center and a few weeks later, I started training to be able to speak to people (I think i'm quite good at it now)

I spent a few months in the call center, made some good friends and picked up some invaluable knowledge, but deep down I was constantly thinking "I've just spent 4 years earning a degree in a field / sector that my heart and mind are set on working in, how do I even get my foot in the door".

Fast-forward a little bit >>

### Banking and Cobalt get my interest

I was catching up with some Uni friends via phone calls (ah those were the days, no WhatsApp, no Telegram etc)

One of my friends told me he's currently working as a Cobalt developer at HSBC.

"Woah, Woah WOAH!, Hold up! you're working at HSBC AND you're a developer (I tried not to linger on the Cobalt element (haha) as I was more interested in how he got his start in Tech)

### Enter FDM

My friend elaborated that he'd come across a Brighton-based consultancy by the name of FDM, which provides graduate training in IT including Software Development, Software Testing, Application Support among others. 

I rang them and had a phone screening, they wanted me to come down to Brighton for an interview / logic test.

I'm in Yorkshire and Brighton, well Brighton is way down there ‚¨áÔ∏è

So I told my parents about this oppurtunity and what I need to do. 

Dad to the rescue and a few weeks later (after finalising a date for me to come down to their office in Brighton) I'm up at 6am and along with my parents and sister and nephews, we're on our way 'down south'.

### smoothing sailing isn't always possible no matter how great the boat is.

One and half hours into the journey, we end up in some gridlock traffic, turns out about half a mile up the motorway, there's pretty bad car crash.

Time starts ticking ‚è∞

I need to be at the FDM office for 12pm üò≤

Queue the human sat-nav known as my dad. üó∫Ô∏è

Numerous country roads, fields and a small village or town, we're back on a stretch of the motorway and merrily on our way.

5 minute to spare and I rush into the FDM office building. Yeah talk about punctual...
